This document explains the Kubernetes-based architecture implemented for a Redis-like project. Each user gets their own isolated Redis instance, represented by a dedicated pod within a managed Kubernetes cluster. The project uses DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) to manage the cluster.

## Architecture Overview

- **Instance Management:** Each user request triggers the creation of a new Redis pod, along with corresponding Kubernetes Service and Ingress resources.
- **Routing:** Path-based routing is used with an Ingress Controller to direct requests to the appropriate Redis instance.
- **TLS/SSL Management:** Certificates are managed using Let's Encrypt via cert-manager to ensure secure communication.

### Components Involved

1. **Pods** - Each Redis instance is deployed as a separate pod.
2. **Services** - A ClusterIP service is created to provide stable internal access to the pod.
3. **Ingress** - An Ingress resource routes external traffic to the correct Redis instance using domain-based routing.
4. **Ingress Controller** - Handles incoming requests and forwards them to the appropriate service.
5. **TLS Certificates** - Managed using cert-manager for HTTPS support.

## Example Configurations

### Deployment Configuration

The following example deploys a single Redis instance:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: service_name
  labels:
    app: service_name
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: service_name
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: service_name
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: workspace-volume
          emptyDir: {}
      containers:
        - name: runner
          image: aneeshseth/breadkv-runner-node
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3005
          volumeMounts:
            - name: workspace-volume
              mountPath: /workspace
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "100m"
              memory: "32Mi"
            limits:
              cpu: "200m"
              memory: "64Mi"
```

### Service Configuration

A ClusterIP service is used to expose the Redis instance within the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service_name
spec:
  selector:
    app: service_name
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      name: redis
      port: 3005
      targetPort: 3005
```

### Ingress Configuration

An Ingress resource is used to handle external requests and route them to the appropriate service based on the domain name.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: service_name
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - service_name.bowbox.click
        - "*.bowbox.click"
      secretName: cert-stage-wildcard
  rules:
    - host: service_name.bowbox.click
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: service_name
                port:
                  number: 3005
```

### TLS Certificate Configuration

Let's Encrypt is used to issue a wildcard certificate for all subdomains of `bowbox.click` using cert-manager.

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: wildcard-stage
  namespace: ingress-nginx
spec:
  secretName: cert-stage-wildcard
  issuerRef:
    name: le-wildcard-issuer
    kind: Issuer
  commonName: "*.bowbox.click"
  dnsNames:
    - "*.bowbox.click"
```

This setup ensures isolation, and secure communication for each user's Redis instance.
