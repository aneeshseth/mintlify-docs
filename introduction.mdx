## Introduction

The goal is simple: any person coming onto the site should be able to access their own instance of a redis server (each on a separate machine), and perform simple operations: store values, get values, and ping.

## Inspiration

The goal wasn't to make this to support the fanciest production workloads or feature rich, instead was to learn about how is an application like this built in the first place. The goal is to build blocks such that the architecture itself can support 1000+ parallel users in theory, and making features (in this case more commands/operations) be simple to add.
